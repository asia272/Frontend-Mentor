## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
- **Using Relative Units**: I initially faced issues with fixed `px` units, but then I learned how `rem`, `em`, and `%` are more flexible and responsive.
- **CSS Variables**: I explored defining and using CSS variables (`--variable-name`) to maintain consistent styling.
- **Responsive Design**: Improved my understanding of viewport width (`vw`), viewport height (`vh`), and percentage-based layouts for a better mobile-friendly design.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts
- Flexbox

## ðŸ“Œ Challenges Faced
1. **Unit Selection:** Initially, I used `px` but realized it wasn't responsive. I switched to `rem`, `%`, and `vh/vw` for better flexibility.
2. **CSS Variables:** At first, I wasnâ€™t sure how to define and use CSS variables, but after some practice, I implemented them successfully.

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements
- Enhance accessibility by improving contrast and adding `aria-labels`.
- Use CSS Grid for better layout structuring.
- Experiment with animations for hover effects.

## ðŸŽ‰ Conclusion
This project helped me strengthen my CSS fundamentals and responsive design skills. Looking forward to taking on more challenges!
