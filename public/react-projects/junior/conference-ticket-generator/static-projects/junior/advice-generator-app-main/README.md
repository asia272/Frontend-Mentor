## 🎯 Challenges Faced
I had issues positioning the **advice button** at the **bottom center** of the card.  
**Solution:** I used `position: absolute;`, `left: 50%;`, and `transform: translateX(-50%);` to center it properly.

1. Click the **dice button** to generate new advice.
2. The advice updates dynamically.
