## Problem Faced
Initially, aligning the testimonial cards correctly was challenging. The layout was not responsive, causing elements to misalign on different screen sizes.

## Solution - Using CSS Grid
To solve this issue, I implemented **CSS Grid**:
- Used `grid-template-areas` to structure the layout efficiently.
- Assigned `grid-area` values to each card for precise positioning.
- Applied `gap: 1rem;` for proper spacing.
- Used **media queries** to ensure mobile responsiveness.

‚úîÔ∏è **Modern UI** with shadows and border-radius.

## Conclusion
By implementing CSS Grid, I successfully created a **responsive and visually appealing testimonial section**. This approach made positioning elements more efficient while maintaining a clean UI across different devices.
